# ⚛️ Quantum Computing

This repo serves as the lair of my personal projects in quantum computing. I'll mainly focus in the implementation of quantum circuits and algorithms, getting to know its inner workings and practical features. I also hope to demonstrate how this knowledge can be applied into solving classical computational problems. In order to do so, I'll be using the ```qiskit``` library, which is built on Python.
